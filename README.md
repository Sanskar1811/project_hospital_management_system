The title of the project is Hospital Management System.
Teck stack used during project : python, django and dtl(django template language), html , css.t 
In this project , I have done 2 sections in Hospital : 1. Patient , 2. Doctor
In patient section , there is a form to fill up patient details such as name , disease like that , In doctor section , i have developed authentication system to validate the doctors 
First doctors has to create their account and then can see the patients appointment alloted in hospital. If the patient has been checked then doctors can remove them from the list to confirm the 
authority to patient has been checked already. Also in doctor section , there is a functionality to change the password if the doctor has beem authenticated.
