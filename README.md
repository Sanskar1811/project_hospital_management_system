The Title of the project is Hospital Management System . Tech stack used during projects :  Python ,  Django , DTL(Django Template Language) , HTML , CSS . I developed two pivotal sections: Patient and Doctor. In the Patient section, I crafted a user-friendly form for capturing patient details like name and disease. Meanwhile, in the Doctor section, I implemented an authentication system ensuring only verified doctors gain access. Doctors can seamlessly create accounts, view patient appointments, and mark them as checked post-examination. Additionally, I integrated a password change functionality for enhanced security.
